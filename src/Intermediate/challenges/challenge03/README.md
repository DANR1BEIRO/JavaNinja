Create a program in Java to manage information about ninjas using inheritance. Develop a base class called "Ninja" and a subclass called "Uchiha."

1. In the Ninja class, define the following attributes:
name
age
village
mission
missionRank
missionStatus

2. Add a method called displayInfo() that displays these attributes.

3. Create a subclass called Uchiha that inherits from Ninja. Add an attribute specialSkill and a method called
displaySpecialSkill() to display the special skill.

4. Override the displayInfo() method in the Uchiha class.
